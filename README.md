# year totals
bash script to find yearly totals of dataset

edit itemType at the top to include term of item type to search. Uses a modified file based off of [the 10,000 records from my MaxMargin repo](https://github.com/lmutter/MaxMargin/blob/main/100000%20Sales%20Records.csv) (call this file records.csv in same folder) with 1st column item types, 2nd column dates, third column total profit.
